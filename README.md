# Russian-Prospects
This is a repository for everything related to any of my Russian Prospects projects. All data is from QuantHockey and EliteProspects.

## Player Model
This repository includes the code for the prospect model, a link to the data is included in the code as it is a Google Sheet.

## Evaluating NHL Point Production Forecasting Methods for Russian Skaters
This repository contains the code, abstract, and forthcoming paper on my poster at the 2025 New England Symposium on Statistics in Sports.

## Future Plans
Any future expansions of work with Russian prospects will also be uploaded here including possible player cards and interactive web app.
