# Russian-Prospects
This is a repository for everything related to any of my Russian Prospects projects. All data is from QuantHockey, Elite Prospects, and Gabe Foley

## Player Cards
This repository includes the data for the prospect player cards as well as the original RStuido analysis and final graphics. The player cards 
consist of 31 skaters drafted in the first three rounds of the 2020-2023 drafts who have not yet played NHL games. 

## Future Plans
Any future expansions of work with Russian prospects will also be uploaded here including a possible future model to predict NHL success. This would
require an expansion of the data pool to include players from the 2004 draft onwards as well as players from the original pool who have played NHL games.
